## Problems Faced

1>Managing variant combinations for products with multiple attributes (such as size, color, and material).   
2>Testing the API ( postman )
## Completed Tasks :

1> Design Database Schemas: Design schemas for storing product data, attributes, and variants in the chosen database.                                

2> Implement APIs: Implement APIs for adding new products, defining attributes and variants, and updating product details.          

3> Enable Retrieval: Enable retrieval of product information along with variants through appropriate API endpoints.

4> Testing: Test the APIs using Postman or similar tools to ensure functionality and reliability.
